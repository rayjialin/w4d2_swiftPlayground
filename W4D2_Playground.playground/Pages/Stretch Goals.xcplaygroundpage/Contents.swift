/*:

Swift 4 introduces a new feature called generic type constraints. You can use this to only add additional functionality to a generic type that matches a certain set of constraints. Let's take a look at the following example
*/
/*:
 Here we are creating a new extension for an Array. Then we have 'where Element : Numeric". This indicates whatever the generic type is delcared for this array, we add a constraint that the generic type also conforms to the 'Numeric' protocol. Assuming that this constraint is satisfied, the function declared inside the extension will be available.

//: Now it's your turn. Create an extension on the 'Queue' data structure you created earlier.
//: For elements that conforms to the 'Numeric' protocol, create a function that adds all numbers together in the queue and print out its total.

 Optional chaining is a process we can use to call properties, methods and subscripts on optionals whose value may or may not be nil. This acts like an alternative way to do force unwrapping but if the optional value is nil, it won't crash the app during runtime.

 Take a look at this example. We have a Person class and a Residence class. The `residence` property can be nil and this is something we should be aware of when checking `numberOfRooms`.
